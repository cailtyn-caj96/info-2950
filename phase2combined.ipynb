    "* The original dataset had different rows be the housing characteristics from rent, household type, rent burden, etc… and the columns were the different neighborhoods. The cleaned data set had the rows be the percent burden of rent and the columns be the five boroughs in NYC.\n",
    "* This dataset was created as a part of an initiative to increase transparency, accessibility, and accountability of the City government.\n",
    "* According to their website, NYC Open Data makes the wealth of public data generated by various New York City agencies and other City organizations available for public use. It is funded by the New York City government. This specific dataset was provided by the Department of City Planning.\n",
    "* Many different politics/policies in NYC affect what type of data is collected. There are many different reasons why these estimates might not be an accurate representation of differences across boroughs including homelessness, lack of documentation, people over or underreporting their income, etc… \n",
    "* We dropped rows of unnecessary housing data that did not look at the rent burden. We also dropped unnecessary neighborhoods that had missing values such as the Staten Island Cemetery. We further cleaned the data by only looking at the median estimates by borough, and median percent estimates by borough and dropped all other columns.\n",
    "* Since this is not personalized data, the people involved might not be fully aware that their data is being used and collected. However, since it is in aggregate form there should be no privacy or expectation concerns.\n",

Furthermore, this data is quite old and does not take into acccount recent political events and policies that likely have afffected housing policy in NYC."

    "In this finalized dataset, we see the median percent of households that are under each division of rent burden by each borough in New York City. Across all boroughs, residents spend a very large amount of their income on rent. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the differences in rent burden between boroughs do not seem that jarring, one large difference is what we see residents in the Bronx pay as a percent of their income vs residents in Manhattan. The percentage of residents that spend more than 35% of their income on living is nearly 50%, while the percent of residents that pay the same income burden on rent in Manhattan is only 35%. If we were also to compare [poverty levels](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/poverty-in-nyc/data-tool.page) from the same time end - 2012, we see that Staten Island held the lowest poverty level at 13.4%, Manhattan the second lowest at 14.7%, Queens at 21.8%, Brooklyn at 22.3%, and the Bronx at 25.2%. \n",
    "\n",
    "The comparisons between poverty and income show us that in neighborhoods that face higher poverty levels, they may actually be more burdened by rent than their wealthier counterparts. This demonstrates a discrepancy in the quality of life and wealth that can be accumulated across boroughs."

    "## Data Limitations:\n",
    "The data in the health survery is all categorial data that is represented by numerical values. While some computations can be peformed on the data, this data set is best used in calulating percentages and showing distribution. When trying to show correlation in a scatterplot the results are inconclusive becasue there are only x amount of categories that the population can fall into. \n",
    "Beyod calculations, this data is also limited because it only includes those who have access to either a cell phone or a landline. This could possible scew the data as those with housing security are less likely to represent a population who does not have access to healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data explanation: \n",
    "This data set is created from a survery given to indivuals in NYC. The data set explores the general health of these residents as well other demographics such as income, gender, etc. The data is all categorical, but is represented as numbers in the dataset. In the finalized data sets we can see how poverty levels in NYC neighborhoods affect an indivuals access to healthcare. The data set can show this relationship by comparing the % of people below poverty in a specific neighborhood to the number of people insured, the number of people who have a regular doctor, and accessiblitiy to needed care. Additionally, this data set can begin to explore access to nutitious foods and vaccinations; however, there may be outside factors that also influence these demograohics that may not be directly seen through income levels.\n",
    "NOTE: This data set is currently incomplete and we are attempting to get access to boroughs and other demographic information that is not for publce use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description:\n",
    "1. In this data set the rows are equal to the indivual answering the survey questions and the columns are equal to the questions asked on the surver. These questions relate to different health statistics(general health, is the particpant insured?,etc)\n",
    "2. This data was complied to track risk behaviors and to have a more comprehensive understanding of New York City's residents health. \n",
    "3. This data collection was funded by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n",
    "4. The data is collected via stratified random sample to find data that gives neighborhood and city-wide information. However, this process is inluenced because data is only collected from households with a landline or residents with a cellular phone. Aditionally, the survey has been only been translated into Spanish, Russian, Chinese , Bengali, and Haitian Creole, which may limit the amount of those who are selected who can participate.\n",
    "5. The data was pre-processed by adding weight to the data collected in an attempt to negate any human biases that were a result of the participants answering questions about themselves. Additionally, the answers from the surveys were translated into numbers ( an answer 'yes' may now equal '1') before being added to the dataframe.\n",
    "6. This data is collected based off of interviews, so all of the human paticpants agreed to the survey and knew their data was going to be collected. It is unclear whether or not the participants had knowledge of how their data was going to be used."

    "## Data Description\n",
    "For the finalized dataset for housing and education data, we combined two datasets. The rows represent different boroughs and school districts within New York City. The columns make up different demographics, including percentage of Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, and other races, along with percentage of students in poverty. Additionally, they show the total number of students at each public school regardless of housing situation, students residing in shelter, the number and percent of students in temporary housing. Poverty is measured by students who qualify for a free or reduced price lunch program or those eligible for Human Resources Administration benefits. Students in temporary housing are defined as any student 21 or younger enrolled in school and experiencing housing instability at any point during the school year. Temporary housing includes sharing the housing of others, in shelter, in hotel/motel, or in other temporary housing. The total numbers of students and students in temporary housing are disaggregated by school, based on the last school or program a student attended. In 2017-18, there were 105,261 students residing in temporary housing at any point throughout the school year.  The total numbers of students and students in temporary housing are disaggregated by school, based on the last school or program a student attended. The final, revised dataset was created in order to study relationships between districts and specific demographics in order to find insights into poverty levels and temporary housing numbers within the districts. The data was collected using multiple data sources, including the DOE's Audited Register, biographic data from the Automate the Schools (ATS) system, and the Location Code Generation and Management System (LCGMS), and the Department of Homeless Services (DHS). Due to the occasional missing demographic data and long-term-absent students not being accounted for, some of the enrollment numbers do not add up. The people surveyed (students within New York City) are probably aware that their demographic and free lunch status is recorded but this information does not affect the data. The original data set can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B8daIcWqa5voZ6YwI-Jy1ZA4WMcZJdzW?usp=sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Limitations\n",
    "One significant limitation within the dataset is that only public schools are accounted for (tne school data accounts for charter schools while the housing data does not). The absense of private schools in the dataset results in inflated poverty, racial minority percentages, and housing data for each district as private schools historically account for a higher level of wealthier and white students due to the tuition and prep needed to admitted. Regarding the housing data, The Federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act requires school districts to ask families to report on their housing situation. Schools are only required to provide the survey when they are aware that there is a change in address so there may be instances where schools have outdated information. Additionally, families might lie about the state of housing in their families in the questionnaires as they do not want schools prying into their family situation so as a result, the actual temporary housing numbers might be lower than they actually are.
