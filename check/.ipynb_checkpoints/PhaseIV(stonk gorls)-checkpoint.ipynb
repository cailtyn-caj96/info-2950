    "# INFO2950 Final Project: GameStop Stock Price and Reddit Post\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "On Janury 28th, 2021, a company that was declining in financial health made a huge comeback in the stock market. The company was GameStop, a digital-first omni channel retailer, offerng games and entertainment products. What was driving the defying force was retail investors, namely the reddit group WallStreetBets. Seeing the hedgefunds shorting the stock, members of the group decided to start a \"revolution\" against the big financial institution by calling on other members to buy and hold the GameStop stock. This increase in demand would be able to drive the stock higher and trigger a \"*short squeeze*\". Short squeeze happens when a stock price rise to a point that it was not sustainabl for the short sellers, which drives them to buy back the shares at a higher price, inflicting massive losses to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our INFO2950 Project would be exploring the relationship between reddit posts on WallStreetBets and the stock price changes of GameStop (GME).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "* How does the sentiment of Reddit posts on WallStreetBets affect GameStop's stock price?\n",
    "* How does the sentiment analysis compared to the traditional approach to analyzing a stock (technical analysis)?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Source of Data\n",
    "### Dataset Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This reddit data set records various data points regarding a collection of reddit posts that were made in relations to the GME stock on the Wall Street Bets page. The rows represent an individual reddit post that was made on the Wall Street Bets page related to the GME stock. The columns represent different aspects of the post. These aspects include the title of the post, the score, number of comments under the post, the body message, and the timestamp. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our raw GME dataset shows the values of the gme stock price every day over the span of Decemeber 15th to April 16th in the rows. The column attributes are open, high, low, close, adjusted close, volume of the shares, technical analysis signals (parabolic SAR and Macd Signals), risk free rate, market returns, and beta. We later would add additional to conduct analysis on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why was this dataset created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This reddit dataset was created because recently WallStreetBets, a subreddit where participants discuss stock and option trading, became mainstream on GameStop shares. The dataset was created to examine the trend of meme stocks, perform correlation analysis of the public sentiment and stock prices, and identify other discussion questions. The gme data came from yahoo finance with purpose of making public stock information easily accessible to investors. **add where we got the additional data for parabolic sar, macd_signal, beta, rf, market return**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Who funded the creation of the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reddit data we found on kaggle came from Gabriel Pedra who scrapped the reddit subreddit data content. There is no reference to funding related to collecting this data set. The gme stock aggregation was funded through Yahoo Finance's personal revenues since it is a for-profit organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This reddit dataset is mainly from the reddit post, and more specifically, GameStop related subreddit. Therefore, all the data observed would be linked to GameStop, such as people’s sentiment towards the stock, the facts they know about the stock and others. However, it would not observe GameStop related posts that may appear in other subreddits. For the gme data, in general the SEC and stock exchange ensure the public display of relevant stock data to public investors. For the GME stock data, there were no public sources that provided intraday stock data, which prevented us from accessing stock prices at a higher frequency level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reddit post data took the csv file with all the raw information and parsed it into a table format. From there the data headings were modified. They were all made lowercase and had the spaces replaced with underscores.  On the other hand, the GME stock data was not pre-processed. We downloaded the file in a csv format, and the headings and column names were unmodified (e.g. capitalization and spaces in headings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, reddit users who posted on GameStop subreddit are involved. Legally speaking, they are aware of the data collection as each user is required to agree to the privacy policy and user agreement. On Reddit website, they also provide an overview of the information collected from the users (account information, communications and content information, activity information and many others). Users are acutely aware that these information are mainly used for company to further optimize the user experience and grow as a platform. However, most users would not bother to read through legal documents when signing up for a Reddit post; therefore, there is a chance that they are not aware of the data collection. No people were involved with the GME stock data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).**\n",

    "### Analysis related to Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression Analysis for Sentiment**: We will be using the sentiment score as a predictor variable on the stock price. We would see whether sentiment is a predictor of stock prices.\n",
    "    * **Input Variable**: Sentiment Intensity Score of the day\n",
    "    * **Output Variable**: Stock price\n",
    "    * **Reasoning and Expectation**: We want to conduct this analysis to model the relationship between sentiment and stock price. Thus, we expect to see a positive regression slope, indicating our hypothesis that the higher the sentiment the higher the stock price. As for the intercept, we would expect the average stock price for neutral days. \n",
    "\n",
    "After we have compared how sentiment analysis performs compared to the best-case scenario on a stand-alone basis, we need to benchmark this correlation to other prediction methods that are commonly used in finance. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine what type of indicators would be best suited for the benchmark, we first need to establish our trading time horizon and determine the length of stock price momentum during our trading time period. As we mentioned above, we will be trading based on daily changes and will have a short term trading horizon. Given our short-term horizon, we will look at daily price changes and will be focusing on swing trading based on momentum. To get a better understanding of what momentum is looking like in our time period, we will calculate the average number of days that the stock price continues moving in either the positive or negative direction before a reversal. For example, a stock that increases in value three days in a row before dropping in value is considered to be a 3 day momentum. "

    "### Analysis related to Technical Analysis Indicators\n",
    "**Correlation Analysis**: we want to compare the days that we buy, sell, hold in the best-case scenario to the days we would buy sell hold using a technical analysis predictor. We will find the correlation between the two to see how good technical analysis was at predicting days we should buy, sell, hold.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Input**: indicator variables (buy, sell, hold) for best case scenarios and each separate technical analysis. \n",
    "   * **Output**: correlations between each technical indicator and the best case scenario\n",
    "   * **Expectations**: We want to conduct this analysis to correlate whether obeying the technical analysis would produce a result that is similar to the best-case scenario. Our hypothesis is that when we compare the technical analysis correlation to the correlations for each technical indicator, the sentiment analysis will be slightly higher. We believe that humans are not fully rational beings and thus can be heavily influenced by sentiment in their stock trades. Thus, sentiment might be a stronger than usual predictor for stock price returns or general directionality of the stock movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we can see how the sentiment analysis predictions stacked up compared to other commonly used technical indicators for swing trading. We can determine if sentiment analysis is a noteworthy approach to predicting the stock price during the period. We can in future exploration, see if the results in this time frame could apply to GME in the future, apply to other heavily shorted stocks, or stocks that have very high social media activity and low shares outstandings among many other possibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "After we see the relationship between the sentiment scores and the stock price, we can explore how volatility of the stock price is and see if it is correlated to days with high reddit post comments or days where the sentiment was strongly skewed in the positive or negative direction. We can also in conjunction check how far off the actual returns deviated from the expected stock returns based on the capital asset pricing model and the fundamental finance theory that price is derived from underlying value. Our ultimate goal is to see if days where there is high deviation from expected returns from actual returns and days with high volatility are correlated with days of high reddit posts and very strong sentiments. If they are highly correlated is it possible that sentiment is a driver for stock performance. We will have to be careful and remember that correlation may not necessarily equal causation. Below is the analysis. \n",

We next want to take a look at the total returns that each of these different methods would have returned us if we followed them. It is likely that our previous accuracy analysis was limited becuase it took on a very black and white in determining how successful the indicator was. This is because it automatically ignored the dates that did not match the best case dates. However, all missed dates are not equally as bad. It is much worse for the indicator to recommend purchasing the stock when it is 10 dollars compared to if it were only 1 dollars off. Thus, we want to supplement our accuracy results from above with the percentage returns that we get over the period when we use this method. "

    "## Conclusion and Results Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen from the sentimental analysis result above, we attempted to measure the sentiment of the reddit post and observe its relationship with the GameStop stock price. We didn't observe a significant correlation between the two. We have found the correlation between the GME daily high price and sentiment to be -0.31, which means that they are moderately nagatively correlated. The linear regression also produced less significant data as the coefficient of determination only explained 4% to 8% of the data. While we have not got the time to conduct statistical evaluation on this draft, but we are trying to do a permutation anaysis to show that the result we got was probably random. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expected a positive sentiment would cause the price to go up; however, the result was the opposite. There are two possible conclusion, one is that the sentiment of the title post was not the core driver of GME stock price; another one is that there may be a lag between how the sentiment is being reflected on the stock price. People needs time to absorb the information from the post and go to their trading platform to purchase or sell stocks. This may explain the low correlation and almost none linear relationship in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of our technical analysis, we saw that in general sentiment analysis performed on par or better than the other technical indicators. In terms of cross over dates with the best case scenario, the sentiment analysis led the pack with the greatest number of accurately predicted days. 9 days compared to the next highest indicator, MACD, which predicted correctly only 3. In terms of accuracy, the sentiment analysis had similar rates as the other technical indicators. Lastly, when it came to percent returns, sentiment analysis had the second highest percent return of about 30%. We can begin to conclude with this data that sentiment analysis was a solid indicator of gme stock price returns compared to the common technical indicators that are used in the stock price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitation of our analysis\n",
    "Due to time constraint, we were not able to perform more analysis to have a well-rounded view of what is happening within the reddit post. We do have exploratory analysis on the reddit post data where we extrapolated the popular words and the length of each posts, but we were not able to conduct any further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance is definitely a huge limitation in our analysis. Since our anaysis produced less statistically significant results, our interpretation is not substantiated by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are limited in our data in terms of transaction costs. In reality, traders cannot constantly be buying and selling stock infinite amounts of time since there are transaction fees and tax implications that are associated with trade. Thus, while sentiment and our best case scenario praised more frequent trades, it might not always be in the best financial interest of the traders to do. \n"

Therefore, we decided to remove the hour-minute-second portion of the timestamp from our reddit post dataset and retained the year-month-date portion.\n",
