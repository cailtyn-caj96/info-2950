    "### Dataset One: [Housing](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographics-and-profiles-at-the-Neighborhood-Tabu/hyuz-tij8)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Description\n",
    "* The original dataset had different rows be the housing characteristics from rent, household type, rent burden, etc… and the columns were the different neighborhoods. The cleaned data set had the rows be the percent burden of rent and the columns be the five boroughs in NYC.\n",
    "* This dataset was created as a part of an initiative to increase transparency, accessibility, and accountability of the City government.\n",
    "* According to their website, NYC Open Data makes the wealth of public data generated by various New York City agencies and other City organizations available for public use. It is funded by the New York City government. This specific dataset was provided by the Department of City Planning.\n",
    "* Many different politics/policies in NYC affect what type of data is collected. There are many different reasons why these estimates might not be an accurate representation of differences across boroughs including homelessness, lack of documentation, people over or underreporting their income, etc… \n",
    "* We dropped rows of unnecessary housing data that did not look at the rent burden. We also dropped unnecessary neighborhoods that had missing values such as the Staten Island Cemetery. We further cleaned the data by only looking at the median estimates by borough, and median percent estimates by borough and dropped all other columns.\n",
    "* Since this is not personalized data, the people involved might not be fully aware that their data is being used and collected. However, since it is in aggregate form there should be no privacy or expectation concerns.\n",
    "* The raw dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mL4DjAYRaL2f184_WdoQd-u0ETNvYvgU/view?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Limitiations\n",
    "* This data shows five year estimates from 2008-2012, so we don't get a glimpse of what is happening year to year and how the rent burden is changing for each district -- it might be getting better or worse for some districts and we cannot exactly tell from the data. Furthermore, this data is quite old and does not take into acccount recent political events and policies that likely have afffected housing policy in NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Two: [Poverty](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYCgov-Poverty-Measure-Data-2018-/hveh-vctc).\n",
    "##### Description\n",
    "* The original dataset is fairly simple - it lists the poverty rate of each community district in NYC and also has rows for a summary of each f the boroughs.\n",
    "* This dataset comes from NYC Open Data as well, as a part of an initiative to increase transparency, accessibility, and accountability of the City government and made possible through funding by the NYC government. This specific dataset came from the Mayor's Office for Econnomic Opportunity.\n",
    "* Many different politics/policies in NYC affect what type of data is collected. There are many different reasons why these estimates might not be an accurate representation of differences across boroughs including homelessness, lack of documentation, people over or underreporting their income, etc… \n",
    "* To clean this dataset, we dropped the summary rows, created a new column to indicate what overall borough the community district was in, convert the percentages to floats for calculations, and sorted it alphabetically by community district.\n",
    "* The NYCgov poverty rate is measured in a different way than the overall US poverty rate. According to their [website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/poverty-in-nyc/poverty-measure.page), the measure includes a threshold that accounts for the higher cost of housing in New York City and incorporates the value of programs intended to alleviate poverty; adjusting family incomes for benefits such as the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n",
    "* Since this data is aggregated, there should be no privacy or expectation concerns for the individual.\n",
    "* The raw dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O_JcvgjGhp79fMZrFzXZX3dnw3ZlMXKL/view?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Limitations\n",
    "* This poverty measure only looks at a specific point in time - 2018 - so we cannot see how poverty levels have changed over time for the community districts which would definitely have an impact on our overall analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Three: [Population](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Population-By-Community-Districts/xi7c-iiu2)\n",
    "##### Description\n",
    "* The orginal dataset looked at population levels across community districts at different points in time -- 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, collected Census Bureaus' Decennial data dissemination. We cleaned our data to only look at the most recent measure of population (2010), that better aligns with our times of our other datasets.\n",
    "* We had to create a new column that combined distict and community number to be able to merge with our other datsets.\n",
    "* The data was provided by the Department of City Planning is owned by NYC Open Data.\n",
    "* We used this data to provide a magnitude measurement for our levels of poverty and rent burden, so we have a better understanding of how many people are affected across districts since popoulation levels vary. \n",
    "* This data is not personalized and does not provide any sensitive information so there should be no privacy concerns.\n",
    "* The raw dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T_HYEXvHoydxVDyuijdM2dSu0P1zM-lZ/view?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Limitations\n",
    "* This measure of population is perpetually changing and being a decade old, is not an extremely accurate measure of population levels right now. However, it does align with our other datasets so it gives us a good look into the general trend.\n",
    "* Census data itself always has its limitations -- people being missed, double reported, inaccurate responses. There is no way to completely know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Four: Student Temp Housing\n",
    "##### Data Description\n",
    "* For the finalized dataset for housing and education data, we combined two datasets. The rows represent different boroughs and school districts within New York City. The columns make up different demographics, including percentage of Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, and other races, along with percentage of students in poverty. Additionally, they show the total number of students at each public school regardless of housing situation, students residing in shelter, the number and percent of students in temporary housing. \n",
    "* Poverty is measured by students who qualify for a free or reduced price lunch program or those eligible for Human Resources Administration benefits. Students in temporary housing are defined as any student 21 or younger enrolled in school and experiencing housing instability at any point during the school year. Temporary housing includes sharing the housing of others, in shelter, in hotel/motel, or in other temporary housing. The total numbers of students and students in temporary housing are disaggregated by school, based on the last school or program a student attended. In 2017-18, there were 105,261 students residing in temporary housing at any point throughout the school year.  \n",
    "* The total numbers of students and students in temporary housing are disaggregated by school, based on the last school or program a student attended. \n",
    "* The final, revised dataset was created in order to study relationships between districts and specific demographics in order to find insights into poverty levels and temporary housing numbers within the districts. \n",
    "* The data was collected using multiple data sources, including the DOE's Audited Register, biographic data from the Automate the Schools (ATS) system, and the Location Code Generation and Management System (LCGMS), and the Department of Homeless Services (DHS). Due to the occasional missing demographic data and long-term-absent students not being accounted for, some of the enrollment numbers do not add up. The people surveyed (students within New York City) are probably aware that their demographic and free lunch status is recorded but this information does not affect the data. \n",
    "* The original data set can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B8daIcWqa5voZ6YwI-Jy1ZA4WMcZJdzW?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Limitations\n",
    "* One significant limitation within the dataset is that only public schools are accounted for (tne school data accounts for charter schools while the housing data does not). The absense of private schools in the dataset results in inflated poverty, racial minority percentages, and housing data for each district as private schools historically account for a higher level of wealthier and white students due to the tuition and prep needed to admitted.\n",
    "* Regarding the housing data, The Federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act requires school districts to ask families to report on their housing situation. Schools are only required to provide the survey when they are aware that there is a change in address so there may be instances where schools have outdated information. Additionally, families might lie about the state of housing in their families in the questionnaires as they do not want schools prying into their family situation so as a result, the actual temporary housing numbers might be lower than they actually are.

    "In our final report, we vow to present the following analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis One:\n",
    "We will plot rent burden (defined as paying >30% income level) by rent level for different neighborhoods grouped by borough to analyze if there is an association between rent level and rent burden. Especically given the economic downturn, we want to look at how housing insecurity has been exacerbated, especially for those already living in low income areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Two: \n",
    "We will look at the type of relationship and correlation between rent burden and minority levels for each of the community districts and determine if there are any statistical differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Three:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze the relationship between racial composition of schools and housing insecurity at the neighborhood/borough level. We will look at multilinear regression model and analyze the individual regression coefficients of the our indicator variables to see how housing insecurity may change based on race. \n",
    "We looked at a line plot that compared our average rent burden percents by borough.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Analysis One**\n",
    "First, we look at how rent burden differs across different boroughs."

    "While the differences in rent burden between boroughs do not seem that jarring, one large difference is what we see residents in the Bronx pay as a percent of their income vs residents in Manhattan. The percentage of residents that spend more than 35% of their income on living is nearly 50%, while the percent of residents that pay the same income burden on rent in Manhattan is only 35%. If we were also to compare [poverty levels](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/poverty-in-nyc/data-tool.page) from the same time end - 2012, we see that Staten Island held the lowest poverty level at 13.4%, Manhattan the second lowest at 14.7%, Queens at 21.8%, Brooklyn at 22.3%, and the Bronx at 25.2%. \n",
    "\n",
    "The comparisons between poverty and income show us that in neighborhoods that face higher poverty levels, they may actually be more burdened by rent than their wealthier counterparts. This demonstrates a discrepancy in the quality of life and wealth that can be accumulated across boroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we look at how rent burden changes based on rent level, specifically based on percentage of households paying low rent. "
